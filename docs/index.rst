Sponge offers you a very simple structure to build your web apps on
top of `CherryPy <http://www.cherrypy.org/>`_.
For instance:

 * Very simple config file.
 * First project always comes with unit and functional tests examples.
 * Really simple routing mechanism.
 * Ready-to-use Image handler controller.
 * Focused in testablility and simplicity.
