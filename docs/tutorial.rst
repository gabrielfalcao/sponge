Bob, your best friend!
----------------------

Sponge comes with `bob`, a command-line utility that will create the
first project structure for you, and even run your projects.

1. Creating your first project:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Run `bob create some-example` on your shell.

 Enter in the created directory: `cd some-example`

 Run `bob go` on your shell.

 Access http://localhost:4000
